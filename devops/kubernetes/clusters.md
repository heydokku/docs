### What is a Cluster?

a computer cluster is a group of two or more computers, or nodes, that run in parallel to achieve a common goal. 
This allows workloads consisting of a high number of individual, parallelizable tasks to be distributed among the nodes in the cluster. 
As a result, these tasks can leverage the combined memory and processing power of each computer to increase overall performance.
